## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/ufDlOKo.png)

The first open-source project I've built on my road to transition from a project manager to a software developer!

Even though I lack experience when it comes to building technically-exciting products, I don't lack the experience to oversell
something not that exciting.

So here we go; `t` is the most minimal todo cli app out there and I wouldn't be lying when I'd say that it's:
* The fastest
* The most secure
* The easiest

Here's why:

* It has barely any lines of code + it being written in Rust, it compiles fast!
* It uses a local `.json` file which is secure because it's on your drive!
* It has merely three commands, come on.

## Built With

Rust! And nothing else.

## Getting Started

In order to use the blazing fast and insanely secure `t`, you can use one of the following two methods:

```sh
cargo install t
```
or clone the repo and simply run:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Usage

Create a new todo:

```sh
t add "<content>"
```

Get the list of all of your todos:

```sh
t list
```

Delete a todo:

```sh
t delete <id>
```
